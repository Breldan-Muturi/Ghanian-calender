DESCRIPTION
The online web app is basically a web page designed using html, css and JavaScript. It's been designed for people interested in Ghananian culture who are curious as to what they'd have been named had they been born in Ghana. Basically in Ghana you can be named depending on what day of the week you were born so the application calculates that day from the birthday you submit.These names vary from Male to Female so it ais also required you enter your Gender so that the app can finally pick out your Akan Name.

To install the project it is necessary to follow these steps:
* Open https://github.com/Turi-byte/Ghananian-calender. On the top right corner of your screen, you should see a button with the text 'Fork'. 
* Clicking on this button should start the process of copying the project/repository to your own account.Click on that button which should result in a modal prompting you to choose the account to which you want to fork.
* Select your account name which should take you to the repo you forked in your account. For example, if your GitHub username is 'Turi-byte', you should select it and not anything else that appears in the modal. This may take a couple of seconds so be patient as the process takes place.
* To know that the forking process is complete, check the top left corner of your repo. You should be in your account in a repo with the same name as the original repository (your_username/Ghananian-calender). This shows that the forking process is complete.
* Having copied the repo to your own account, you can then proceed to clone it.Run the git clone command to clone the repo to your preferred location.
* Navigate to inside the cloned repository by using the change directory (cd) command.
* Open your editor by using the command atom . for Atom users or code . for Visual Studio Code users.
* You are now ready to inspect and make modifications to the project.


Known Bugs
The app basically assumes that each month has a maximum of 31 days but we know this is not the case especially in instances where a person was born in February the 29th. The app makes no considerations for this and might mislead the User into getting the wrong Akan Name.
The other bug is that the search bar is non-functional, I put it for practice purposes so that in future projects I can put it and have it active for anyone who is searching for anything on my page.


Technologies Used
bootstrap was used in designing the webpage and making it even more appealing to the user. various css stylesheets were used for different pages so that different backgrounf images could be used.
